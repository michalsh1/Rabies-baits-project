## Project's goal:

Calculate how many rabies baites were released during a desired time and a desired area.

<br>

## Background:
Rabies is...

In order to control rabies disease INPA is conducting a management program where baits containing the vaccine is being scattered around the country.

The baits are scattered by mainly using airplanes, but also by INPA employees by foot.

<br>

## Original files:
At the beginning I was given the following files:
- SHP files of all the routes that were recorder by two different pilots.
    -   They were supposed to have date, number of baits that were released and more info.
- Excel files with the management calculations dor each year. Each column consisted the following: date, number of baits released, area...

<br>

## Work process

### Cleaning SHP files
using QGIS I had to find all doubles and keep only relevant file

I mathced SHP files to the excel in order to find irragularities and issues to be solved.

<br>

### Creating a database using Django (SQLite)
